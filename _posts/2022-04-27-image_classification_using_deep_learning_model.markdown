My major in university is Biomedical Engineering, in which medical image processing is a major field. I have previously learned image segmentation, image reconstruction, and image classification, etc. However, I have not used deep learning models in these analyses before, since deep learning model has not been developed at 2004. And I am glad to have a chance to do medical image classification using deep learning model.

In this project, I tried to do image classification of chest xray images to see whether it is belonging to a healthy person or a patient with pneumonia, with the images download from kraggle:  ![](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia)
